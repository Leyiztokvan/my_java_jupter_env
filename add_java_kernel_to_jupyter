    # Note: if you have an old installation or a debug one from running gradlew installKernel it is suggested that it is first removed via jupyter kernelspec remove java.
    # A prepackaged distribution will be in an artifact named ijava-$version.zip.
    # Unzip it into a temporary location. It should have at least the install.py and java folder extracted in there.

    # The installer is a python script and has the same options as jupyter kernelspec install but additionally supports configuring some of the kernel properties mentioned further below in the README.
